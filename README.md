Still fresh out of tutorials, i don't currently have projects going on

if you have ideas, hit me up, LasevIX_#0627 on Discord. 
##### Planned projects: text editor written in Py and rewritten later in C++
###### next languages I'll learn: Rust(seems cool and less painful than C++), Javascript(just to understand webdevs lol), Haskell(functional seems like a must for discovering new shit), Java(most people find it horrible but it's apparently a favourite for some, it might be mine later... also that a lot of server apps and programs are written in it) [note: not in that order]

please don't judge anything here, i'm still a newbie after 2 years of procrasinating and probably still will be in 5 years
